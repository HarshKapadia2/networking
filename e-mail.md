## Protocols

### Transfer protocols

- Send e-mail: SMTP
- Receive e-mail: POP3, IMAP

#### SMTP

- SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- OSI Layer: Application Layer
- Port: 25 (default, insecure), 2525 (insecure), 587 (secure with [TLS](tls.md)) & 465 (deprecated, secure with TLS)
- TCP/UDP: TCP
- Only used to send e-mails
  - from sender to sender's mail server
  - from sender's mail server to receiver's mail server
- It is a 'Push Protocol' as it is used to send data.
- Uses TCP, so it is a connection oriented protocol.

#### POP3

- POP3: Post Office Protocol 3
- OSI Layer: Application Layer
- Port: 110 (insecure) & 995 (secure with TLS)
- TCP/UDP: TCP
- Only used to receive e-mails from receivers's mail server to receiver.
- It is a 'Pull Protocol' as it is used to receive data.
- Uses TCP, so it is a connection oriented protocol.
- Does not provide synchronization of e-mails and folders.
- One e-mail delivered to one of receiver's devices, the e-mail is deleted from the server. (It can be configured to prevent this though.)

#### IMAP

- IMAP: Internet Message Access Protocol
- OSI Layer: Application Layer
- Port: 143 (insecure) & 993 (secure with TLS)
- TCP/UDP: TCP
- Only used to receive e-mails from receivers's mail server to receiver.
- It is a 'Pull Protocol' as it is used to receive data.
- Uses TCP, so it is a connection oriented protocol.
- Provides synchronization of e-mails and folders.
- The e-mail is kept on the server and local copies are cached on devices as well.

### Utility protocols

#### MIME

- MIME: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
- Supplementary/add-on protocol to the e-mail transfer protocols.
- e-mail transfer protocols can inherently only transfer normal text (NVT 7-bit ASCII) data, but it uses the MIME to extend its capabilities.
- MIME allows the user to send audio, video, image and other types of files via e-mail. It also helps support different languages like German, French, etc. that don't follow the 7-bit ASCII format.
- Converts files to the NVT 7-bit format for sending them and parses them back to their original format on the other end.
- Although MIME was created for [SMTP](#smtp), it can be used with [POP3](#pop3), [IMAP](#imap) and [HTTP](http.md) as well.
- MIME headers
  - `Mime-Version: 1.1`
  - `Content-Type: media-type/media-subtype` (Eg: `text/html`, `multipart/form-data`, `image/png`, `video/mp4`, `text/css`, `audio/mp3`, etc.)
  - `Content-Transfer-Encoding` (Values: `7bit`, `8bit`, `base64`, etc.)
  - `Content-Id`
  - `Content-Description`

</p>


### Security protocols

#### PGP

- PGP: Pretty Good Privacy
- Provides
  - Authentication (using the Web of Trust - importing the receiver's public key into the sender's key ring)
  - Confidentiality (using a combo of symmetric/conventional and asymmetric key cryptography)
- Used for signing, encrypting and decrypting e-mails, files, directories, disks, etc.
- It uses the decentralized 'Web of Trust' to verify the identity of users. (Key rings and graphs)

#### S/MIME

- S/MIME: Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
- Provides security (authentication and encryption) for e-mails.
- Main functions
  - Digital signature (authentication and non-repudiation)
  - Encryption (integrity and confidentiality)
