== Review Questions

NOTE: link:./tls.html#review-questions[Assignment questions and instructions]

=== Network Traffic Interception

(Q 1.1)

Ways in which an attacker can intercept network traffic

* ARP Spoofing
* DNS Cache Poisoning
* Attacks on BGP
	** One-hop Attack
	** Sub-prefix Hijacking


All the attacks listed above cause packets to be routed to a machine controlled by the attacker (interception), so that they can read and/or manipulate traffic, and monitor activity and/or carry out attacks.

Attackers can usually cause most damage when they are in the same local network as their victims, which is why everyone cautions against using public WiFi Access Points for insecure HTTP browsing and sensitive internet usage, such as internet banking.

=== TLS Protection

(Q 1.2)

Protections TLS provides to reduce problems caused by interceptions

* TLS makes use of link:https://networking.harshkapadia.me/cryptography#digital-certificates-and-certificate-revocation-ocsp-and-crl[Digital Certificates] to prove identity, so an interception attempt will fail, because the attacker will not be able to provide a valid certificate for the actual server.
* TLS includes random values in its messages and uses those values in its integrity checking, so even if an attacker is recording all messages, they cannot replay them, as the server will generate a different random value for every connection, which will lead to the handshake failing.
* TLS uses the link:https://networking.harshkapadia.me/cryptography#diffie-hellman[Diffie-Hellman (DH) Key Exchange Algorithm] to exchange key generation material and the algorithm has been created such that the master secret cannot be created by someone intercepting the connection.
	** link:https://networking.harshkapadia.me/cryptography#perfect-forward-secrecy[Perfect Forward Secrecy] is also provided by TLS connections using the Ephemeral DH (DHE) Key Exchange Algorithm, which implies that even if the attacker is able to compromise the key material of the current TLS session, they cannot compromise the previous or future connections using those values.
* Once new keys are generated on both ends at the end of a TLS handshake, TLS encrypts all the handshake messages on both ends and sends it across in a Finished message. The client and the server compare these exchanged encrypted messages and only if they match, does the handshake succeed. An attacker who has intercepted a message and modified it will be caught here, as they cannot change the encrypted 'Finished' message.
* After the handshake is complete, TLS encrypts and MACs all application data, so an attacker cannot understand the data being shared and cannot even mess with the encrypted data due to the MAC signature.

=== Importance of Certificates in TLS

(Q 1.3)

link:https://networking.harshkapadia.me/cryptography#digital-certificates-and-certificate-revocation-ocsp-and-crl[Digital Certificates] are a key component of TLS, as they provide authentication, i.e., they prove that the server the client is communicating with, is actually the server that they requested and not someone impersonating the server.

NOTE: If an impersonating server sends another server's certificate to the client, the impersonating server won't be able to produce a valid signature for the Diffie-Hellman `g^b` value that it sends to the client, as it does not have access to the private key of that certificate to create a valid signature.

So, a LOT of the security of TLS is dependent on the client verifying the server's certificate chain. In the absence of this, anyone can impersonate the real server. An attacker can intercept messages and can carry out a Monkey in the Middle (MITM) Attack.

In a certificate chain, each certificate is signed by the certificate having higher authority that it and this finally ends at the root certificate by a Certificate Authority (CA), which has the highest authority and is self-signed. This self-signed root certificate is a trusted certificate that ships with Operating Systems and browsers.

Generally when attackers want to play mischief and impersonate a site, they cannot get a CA to sign their fake impersonated certificate (because a real certificate for that site exists and the attacker is not the owner of the actual domain), so attackers self-sign their fake certificate. Web browsers and protocols are smart-enough to realise that a self-signed certificate that is not signed by any trusted CAs signals security issues and so does not let the user access the site.

So if the signature verification is skipped, then an attacker presenting a fake self-signed certificate will not be caught and a successful MITM Attack can be carried out.

The MITM Attack:

* The client starts communication with the server by first establishing a TCP connection with it and then sending a Client Hello message.
* The server responds with a Server Hello message and its certificates.
* The attacker will replace the legitimate certificate chain with its own fake self-signed certificate, change and sign the Diffie-Hellman parameter sent by the server (`g^b` to `g^b'`) using the public key in the fake certificate and then send it to the client.
* As the client is not verifying the signature on the certificate it is being presented, it accepts the fake certificate, fake signature and malicious `g^b'` pre-master secret, and successfully verifies the pre-master secret (`g^b'`) using the public key in the fake certificate.
* The attacker then compromises the Client Key Exchange message, where instead of the server receiving `g^a` from the client, it receives `g^a'` from the attacker, as the attacker has intercepted the actual value (`g^a`).
* Thus, the attacker was able to generate a different set of keys for the client (`g^ab'`) and the server (`g^a\'b`), and every time messages are exchanged between the two, it will decrypt the intercepted messages, make modifications as necessary, encrypt them again and send them across.
* The attacker then encrypts and MACs the client and server Finished messages, thus acting as a transparent proxy, unbeknownst to the two communicating parties.

== Tinkering with TLS

NOTE: link:./tls.html#tinkering-with-tls[Assignment questions and instructions]

=== Missing `client_random` Value

(Q 2.1)

The protocol is secure against Replay Attacks even with the `client_random` value missing, due to the presence of the `server_random` value.

If an attacker decides to replay client messages, the server will send a different server random value each time, so the generated master secret will be different each time, leading to the generation of different messages, message hashes and cipher texts, which will cause the TLS handshake to fail in the final Finished message stage.

=== Missing `server_random` Value

(Q 2.2)

TLS 1.2 is not secure against Replay Attacks if Key Encapsulation or Static Diffie-Hellman (DH) Key Exchange Algorithm are used to exchange keys, but TLS 1.2 is secure against Replay Attacks if the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) Key Exchange Algorithm is used.

==== Key Encapsulation or Static DH

When a TLS handshake is using Key Encapsulation or Static DH, an attacker can replay client messages to have the server generate the same responses every time messages are replayed, thus allowing Replay Attacks.

Replay attacks allow the attacker to repeat the encrypted application data communication with the server, which can cause some unwanted repeated actions on user data, depending on the contents of the request. The attacker will not be able to read and understand the encrypted data, but they don't need to do that to cause harm. They can keep doing these attacks for a lot of connections and they will eventually replay a message that modifies the state of a user's data, thus causing problems.

To carry out this attack, the attacker has to

* Capture and store all messages of a TLS communication.
* Establish a TCP connection with the server.
* Blindly replay all the stored messages (the ones sent from the client to the server) without changing their contents, one-by-one in order of timestamp as the server keeps responding.

The attacker has to send the following intercepted messages unchanged one-by-one in order, after creating a TCP connection with the server:

* Client Hello
* Client Key Exchange
* Finished
* Application data

==== DHE

With the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) Key Exchange Algorithm, new key generation material is generated for every connection, to maintain link:https://networking.harshkapadia.me/cryptography#perfect-forward-secrecy[Perfect Forward Secrecy].

NOTE: It is being assumed that the server does not cache the key generation material (`b`, `g`, `p`, `g^b`, etc.).

This means that if no caching is assumed, the absence of the `server_random` value does not make TLS 1.2 vulnerable to Replay Attacks. The newly generated Key Exchange parameters provide the same protection as the `server_random` value does.

=== Missing Hash Value

(Q 2.3)

TLS 1.2 is vulnerable to Downgrade attacks whether hashes are present or not, but missing hash values in the handshake makes it easier to carry out these attacks, as it is an important checking mechanism against tampering.

An attacker intercepting communication can modify a TLS Client Hello message and strip out all the strong cipher suites and just use weak ones. The server then choses the best one out of the weak cipher suites it receives. The attacker records all the parameters that it receives and can trivially figure out the keys due to the weak ciphers used. Thus, the attacker can now selectively encrypt, decrypt and modify messages and transparently read and/or modify messages without anyone noticing.

The presence of hashes in the Finished message just slows down the attacker as it has to compute a new hash (which is computer from a version of all messages exchanged in the handshake that includes the modifications it made to all the previous messages). This can cause timeout issues leading to handshake failure, but the absence of hashes eases some of that burden on the attacker, speeding up the attack, thus leading to better chances of the attack succeeding.

=== Configuring Host Operating System

* In this case, the host Operating System (OS) is Microsoft Windows 11.

* To be able to redirect the target domain to another web page, it has to be redirected on the OS.
+
Add the following lines to the `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file.

[source, shell]
----
# Added by Harsh Kapadia for BU CAS CS 558
127.0.0.1 harshkapadia.me
127.0.0.1 networking.harshkapadia.me
----

NOTE: The sub-domains of `harshkapadia.me` (eg: `networking.harshkapadia.me`) have to be added individually, as the `hosts` file does not support wildcards (`*.harshkapadia.me`).

* To serve an alternate page once the domain is hijacked, create an `index.html` file outside the CA and target domain directories.

[source, shell]
----
X:\ms-bu\sem-2\bu-cas-cs-558\cert-hw>vim index.html # Add content shown below
X:\ms-bu\sem-2\bu-cas-cs-558\cert-hw>cat index.html
<html>
        <head>
                <title>Harsh Kapadia</title>
        </head>

        <body style="text-align: center;">
                <h1>Harsh Kapadia</h1>
        </body>
</html>
----

* The CA certificate (`bucs558-ca.crt`) is a root certificate that is providing trust to the certificate (`harshkapadia.me.crt`) that we created for the target domain (`harshkapadia.me`). The host OS and browser doesn't trust the CA root certificate (`bucs558-ca.crt`) though, so the domain certificate (`harshkapadia.me.crt`) won't be accepted. So, the root certificate (`bucs558-ca.crt`) needs to be added to the OS's certificate store manually. Adding the root certificate separately to the browser's key store might also be required (like in Mozilla Firefox, as shown below).

* To be able to carry out the attack, there has to be a TLS terminating server (link:https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.1/man1/openssl-s_server.html[`openssl s_server`^]) running that captures the request to the target domain (`harshkapadia.me`) that was redirected to `127.0.0.1` (`localhost`) by the OS due to the `host` file configuration above.
	** The server is listening at port 443, as that is the default port for HTTPS requests.

NOTE: The command below has to be run from the directory where the `index.html` file was created.

[source, shell]

=== Accessing the Target Domain

* Now on going to `https://harshkapadia.me/index.html` or `https://networking.harshkapadia.me/index.html`, instead of seeing the original web site, the highjacked `index.html` file is visible with a lock beside the URL, which means that the browser accepted the phony certificates that we presented it. Thus, the browser has been tricked.

==== Original Web Pages

This is how the two web pages looked before hijacking:

.Base domain: `https://harshkapadia.me/index.html`
image::og-domain-page.png[]

.Sub domain: `https://networking.harshkapadia.me/index.html`
image::og-sub-domain-page.png[]

==== Mozilla Firefox

After the hijacking:

.Base domain: `https://harshkapadia.me/index.html`
